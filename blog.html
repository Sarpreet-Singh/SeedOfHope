                                <p>Our team here has had deep thought about what sort of sound effects and music needs to be implemented to really bring the game to life.
                                   We take pride on how our game sounds and feels as we want to outreach expectations,
                                   whil st giving you a reason to love the game.
                                   The creative and technical team as of february 2020 has started to involve enticing sound effects in the game.
                                    These include sounds when collecting loot, using weapons and NPCs.

                                  Moreover, our soundtracks will have you emotionally invested into the game.
                                  We have chosen these music tracks to give you a specific feel in areas along the game as each area and part of the game is unique.
                                   These are set to be implemented before March 6th and will be available in the new updated downloadable file on this website!

                                  Sounds all good right?
                                   We still need to consider testing when each new feature is added and now that Seed Of Hope is coming along at a good
                                   speed we are finally at the stage of playthrough testing.
                                    This will now begin and will require members of the public to help our team and play through the game exclusively so that
                                    we can observe game behavior and patch any glitches or bugs we come across.
                                    This is so we can refine The Seed Of Hope so that our loyal gamers will not have an ounce of disappointment upon final release!

                                <p>Since the last blog, our team has really come together to bring the game to life.
                                   The Seed Of Hope development team has implemented many of the features that we promised to bring to you.
                                   This includes the immersive storyline coming into action, the smooth graphics,
                                    inventory system and spectacular sounds.

                                Without the cohesion between the two subgroups (technical and non technical),
                                 the development of the game would be severely stunted.
                                 Our team is working together to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical by implementing
                                  awesome graphics into the game and making them interactive.

For example, our 2D game has zoom features, inventory, collectables, cut-scenes and much more as you will find out for yourself.

                                  Furthermore, there is the creative side of the team in charge of the graphics, story, map and most things visual to you, the player. Our creative design team has also put their all into bringing every emotion out of the game, from the map tiles, to the creation of the characters. Not to forget the sound effects and music board that you will love. We as a team have used various software and techniques to create assets and sprites for the game; some that help you progress and others that are there to catch your eye.
